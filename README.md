First you need to download livewire into the project

### After following the steps this error appears

To resolve the error, follow these steps :

## Publishing Livewire Assets

One of the most direct methods to resolve this issue is to publish the Livewire assets using the following command:

```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=livewire:assets
```

## Modifying the asset_url in Livewireâ€™s Configuration

```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire:config
```

After publishing the config file, locate the `asset_url` setting in the `config/livewire.php` file and change it to match your local or production domain, like so:

```bash
   'asset_url' => "http://localhost/my_project/public",
```

But I prefer to use the `APP_URL` configuration of the application to set the `asset_url` Livewire variable:


```bash
   'asset_url' => env('APP_URL'),
```

Apply your URL in  `.env`
